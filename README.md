Hi ðŸ‘‹ Everyone!

My name is AndrÃ© and in short I'm a self learner.

Currently, on my free time I'am focused on learning more about Web Development and technologies that are used for either _backend_ or _frontend_ development.
With the aid of different online learning platforms I adquired a special taste for JavaScript. For which I am trying to master as I learn.

The path is long and I wish to keep learning and improving my skills so I can one day work in Web Development.

The knowledge I've gather during my learning path is present on my Git Repositories. If you stumble on my profile feel free to have a look. If you wish to work on anything I've done or just to give advice, feel free to reach out to me. :smile:
