Hi ðŸ‘‹ Everyone! 

My name is AndrÃ© andi n short I'm a self learner.

Currently, I've been focusing myself in learning more about Web Development and all types of technologies used for _backend_ development and database management.
With the aid of different online learning platforms I am focused on learning NodeJS and MongoDB. 

The knowledge I've gather during my learning path is present on my Git Repositories.

The path is long and I wish to keep learning and improving my skills so I can one day work in Web Development.
